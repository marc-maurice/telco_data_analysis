# Telco Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes a telecommunications dataset to extract insights into customer behavior, churn patterns, and service usage. The goal is to identify trends and improve decision-making for customer retention strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset includes customer demographics, subscription details, and usage statistics. Key features analyzed:
- Customer tenure and contract type
- Monthly charges and total spending
- Churn rate and influencing factors

## Analysis Approach
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Cleaning, summarizing, and visualizing data to identify trends.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating meaningful variables for predictive insights.
- **Statistical and Machine Learning Models:** Evaluating customer churn risk and behavior patterns.

## Key Insights
